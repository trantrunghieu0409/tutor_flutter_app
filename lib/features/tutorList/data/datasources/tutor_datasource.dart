I also enjoy watching rugby on the weekends, reading and watching podcasts on Youtube. My most memorable life experience would be living in and traveling around Southeast Asia.'),

      'Hello! My name is April Baldo, you can just call me Teacher April. I am an English teacher and currently teaching in senior high school. I have been teaching grammar and literature for almost 10 years. I am fond of reading and teaching literature as one way of knowing oneâ€™s beliefs and culture. I am friendly and full of positivity. I love teaching because I know each student has something to bring on. Molding them to become an individual is a great success.')
